## Vision Statement

To become the global standard for digital celebration, enabling every festival, milestone, and special moment to be commemorated, shared, and owned as a unique digital asset—forever.

## The Problem

- **Disposable Greetings:** Traditional greeting cards are easily lost, forgotten, or lack a personal touch in the digital age.
- **Impersonal Digital Messages:** Digital greetings are often generic, impersonal, and lack permanence or true ownership.
- **No Proof of Authenticity:** There is no easy way to prove the authenticity or uniqueness of a digital greeting, nor to collect or trade them as valuable digital assets.
- **Missed Opportunities for Connection:** Festival moments are fleeting, and there is no platform that truly captures the spirit, emotion, and value of these celebrations in a lasting, meaningful way.
